<ul>
<li>The lower basic density, greater decay, greater kino, and higher gross and net shrinkage angle observed in the lower stem are likely to have negative <strong>implications</strong> for the processors of plantation-grown E. globulus wood. (Hamilton et al., 2007)</li>
<li>These longitudinal trends have adverse <strong>implications</strong> for forest managers and wood processors given that the lower stem represents a high proportion of total stem volume and produces logs of the greatest diameter. (Hamilton et al., 2007)</li>
<li>However, the ability to interpret these interactions and discuss their <strong>implications</strong> varied among traits. (Hamilton et al., 2007)</li>
<li>So et al. (2) introduced many articles systematically and determined that the rapid assessment of solid wood properties using NIR spectra was a fast-growing field that had broad <strong>implications</strong> in relation to wood quality and, ultimately, tree improvement. (Tsuchikawa, 2007)</li>
<li>They investigated the importance of the sampling technique and the <strong>implications</strong> on the NIR spectra quality and precision of the property estimations. (Tsuchikawa, Schwanninger, 2013)</li>

<li>The non19 synchronous anthesis, does, however, have <strong>implications</strong> for management of seed orchards, as 20 synchronous anthesis is important to optimise outcrossing of open pollinated seed. (Unknown, 2013)</li>
<li>The role of heat sum in anthesis time has 18 obvious <strong>implications</strong> for future management of E. globulus seed orchards, plantations and 19 natural populations as there is clear evidence of global warming, including within the E. 20 globulus range where the mean annual temperature is predicted to be 2-3�C higher by 2100 21 (Christensen et al.

<li>Accordingly, racial variation in the timing of heteroblastic phase change in E.  denticulata/E.  nitens is likely to have broad ecological consequences in both native and planted stands, with potential <strong>implications</strong> for the control of pests and diseases in the latter.

<li>Yet, if the overall trends observed truly reflect the general relationship between PAL and lignin content at all stages of plant development, then there are at least four important <strong>implications</strong> for the role of PAL in vivo; however, it must be emphasized that caution needs to be exercised in making these extrapolations.

<li>The <strong>implications</strong> of these results for sawn timber breeding will depend on the strength of genetic correlations between core traits and rotation-age objective traits and objective trait economic weights. (Hamilton et al., 2009)</li>
<li>The improvement of pulpwood traits is also likely to have favourable <strong>implications</strong> for sawn timber producers. (Hamilton et al., 2009)</li>
<li>Differences between sites, racial and additive genetic variation, intertrait correlations and intersite genetic correlations were estimated and <strong>implications</strong> for pulpwood and appearance-grade timber breeding discussed. (Hamilton et al., 2009)</li>
<li>However, the Southern race also exhibited the greatest net shrinkage, with possible adverse <strong>implications</strong> for its drying properties and stability in use. (Hamilton et al., 2009)</li>
<li>Further research is required to elucidate the effects of silviculture and environment on the genetic expression of shrinkage traits and examine the practical <strong>implications</strong> of any such effects for breeding and forest management. (Hamilton et al., 2009)</li>
<li>The existence of heterogeneous intertrait genetic correlations across sites has adverse <strong>implications</strong> for breeding programmes that assume standard values for these parameters to predict breeding values. (Hamilton et al., 2009)</li>
<li>The significant and positive genetic correlations observed between DBH and all shrinkage traits (at one or both sites) and among basic density, cellulose content and net shrinkage may have adverse <strong>implications</strong> for appearancegrade timber breeders wishing to utilise pulpwood-breeding populations as a genetic resource and/or improve pulpwood  and solid-wood traits simultaneously in a single breeding population. (Hamilton et al., 2009)</li>
<li>However, in the absence of precise economic weights for E. nitens appear-  Tree Genetics &amp; Genomes (2009) 5:307<u+fffd>316  315  ance-grade timber traits, it was not possible to definitively determine the net effect these conflicting genetic correlations on expected genetic gains or their <strong>implications</strong> for appearance-grade sawn timber breeding strategies.

<li>Further research is required to elucidate the effect of silviculture and/or environment on the genetic expression of collapse and the practical <strong>implications</strong> of any such interactions for breeding programmes. (Hamilton, 2007)</li>
<li>These longitudinal trends have adverse <strong>implications</strong> for forest managers and wood processors given that the lower stem represents a high proportion of total stem volume, is pruned at substantial expense under some solidwood silvicultural regimes and produces logs of the greatest diameter.

<li>These findings have substantial <strong>implications</strong> for tree growth of a younger cohort of shortleaf pine (Fig. 2), specifically that the growth rates may be increasing. (Kabrick et al., 2007)</li>
<li>Other authors at this conference present their interpretation of shortleaf pine stand dynamics and influences; in this paper, we examine trends, status, and <strong>implications</strong> of the structure and composition of shortleaf pine forests in the eastern United States.

<li>39  5 Conclusions and <strong>implications</strong> for tree breeding Based on the results presented in this thesis, the following conclusions were made: <u+fffd> The genetic variation ( 0.8) and heritability ( 0.35) of grain angle under bark in mature wood appeared to be as high as in juvenile wood in Norway spruce and Scots pine, indicating that predicting grain angle breeding values and genetic selection for lower grain angle are possible in mature wood as well as juvenile wood. (Hallingback, 2010)</u+fffd></li>
<li>Juvenile-mature wood genetic correlations for grain angle also need to be estimated, since they will have <strong>implications</strong> for the possibility to reduce twist in timber sawn from the mature wood part of the tree. (Hallingback, 2010)</li>

<li>Practical <strong>implications</strong> and conclusions Heritability and CVA estimated from progeny of Norway spruce and Scots pine generated by open pollination were not significantly different from those of progeny generated by controlled crosses, and consequently large overestimations of these parameters due to the assumption of true half-sibs appear very unlikely in Norway spruce and Scots pine.

<li>Changes in the phenological patterns caused by climatic warming can have major <strong>implications</strong> for both the global carbon cycle [5] and the ecology of plants [6] and their herbivores [7]. (Hanninen, Tanino, 2011)</li>
<li>Such acceleration will have considerable <strong>implications</strong> for both the risk of frost damage [12<u+fffd>15] and the photosynthetic production [5,16,17] of the trees, with the photosynthetic production also feeding back to the climate system [2]. (Hanninen, Tanino, 2011)</u+fffd></li>
<li>The differences will also have important <strong>implications</strong> for practical forestry and horticulture, such as the need to reassess the suitability of a given tree provenance or cultivar used earlier in forest regeneration or fruit production. (Hanninen, Tanino, 2011)</li>

<li>The specific objectives of this study were to (i) analyse Dothistroma infection scores on 16 affected sites in northeastern Victoria and estimate genetic parameters including heritabilities and correlations with other selection traits, (ii) develop a bioeconomic model linking defoliation with plantation profitability and derive relative economic weights for Dothistroma resistance for different site hazard ratings, (iii) derive deployment and selection indices for different Dothistroma hazard ratings based on estimated genetic parameters and relative economic weights, and (iv) calculate potential genetic gains and discuss the <strong>implications</strong> for a breeding strategy.

<li>However, previous forest genetic studies have not examined the effects of different levels of relatedness and survival when modelling competition at the genetic level, nor evaluated the <strong>implications</strong> of trait genetic architecture on response to selection when inter-tree competition is present. (Costa e Silva, Kerr, 2013)</li>
<li>Yet, it is important to gauge the correct number of significant competitors because: (a) if this number is overestimated, there is a risk that genetic competition will not be detected, especially if the signal is already inherently weak; and (b) it has <strong>implications</strong> for the prediction of selection response, assuming that response is based on total breeding value. (Costa e Silva, Kerr, 2013)</li>
<li>Considering their <strong>implications</strong> for tree improvement programmes (which typically have not been considering genetic competition effects), key conclusions to be drawn from the current work can be summarised as follows: &amp; If genetic competition is present but not modelled, variance estimates obtained for additive genetic and residual effects may be biased.

<li>696  SUPPLEMENTARY CHAPTER 1  S1.6 Genetic linkage and its <strong>implications</strong> First reported in sweet pea (Lathrytus adoratus) by Cambridge University geneticists, genetic linkage is the phenomenon whereby certain genes tend to be inherited together. (Acquaah, 2012)</li>
<li>In addition to these features, certain <strong>implications</strong> deserve emphasis. (Acquaah, 2012)</li>
<li>Results of BIPLOT analysis have several <strong>implications</strong> for future breeding and cultivar evaluation. (Acquaah, 2012)</li>
<li>To consider the <strong>implications</strong> of constraints (5.25) and (5.26), we express the columns of F and A as F = [f1, …, fm] and A = [a1, …, am], where the elements of fk are called the kth PC scores and those of ak are called the kth loadings (k = 1, …, m). (Adachi, 2016)</li>

<li>However, given the scale of the global extinction crisis (there are nearly 1,000 threatened species in the United States alone), the conservation <strong>implications</strong> of high-tech assisted reproductive technology are extremely modest (Asa, 2001). (Amato et al., 2009)</li>
<li>Unless we acquire full knowledge of the function of all the genes, the <strong>implications</strong> of the interactions between genes, the roles that variant alleles play in diverse environments, and the future environmental challenges that species will face, it may be folly to think that we could engineer genotypes that are better able to survive than those that have resulted from billions of years of natural evolution.

<li>Three potential explanations of chaotic patchiness have been proposed, all of which have conservation <strong>implications</strong>. (Amato et al., 2009)</li>
<li>In particular, if evidence from data sources as distinct as genetic studies and the ecology of reserves provides similar answers about neighborhood size, then confidence in the <strong>implications</strong> might increase. (Amato et al., 2009)</li>
<li>The Implications of Neighborhood Size If marine neighborhoods are large, and populations are generally open over large spatial scales, then offspring are unlikely to settle in the same place as their parents, generating two important <strong>implications</strong> for marine conservation biology. (Amato et al., 2009)</li>
<li>The importance of both these <strong>implications</strong> hinges on the relative size of population neighborhoods and the scale of conservation efforts. (Amato et al., 2009)</li>
<li>When the neighborhood is large compared with protected areas, then these <strong>implications</strong> strongly apply (Botsford et al., 2003). (Amato et al., 2009)</li>

<li>My past research has focused on the <strong>implications</strong> of biological complexity on epistemological issues.2 That is, if complex systems such as organisms, social insect colonies, or ecosystems engage multiple, interacting (and not always linearly related) causal factors, then how should our scientific models and explanations represent that complexity? (Amato et al., 2009)</li>
<li>Acknowledging complexity in nature has <strong>implications</strong> not just for our scientific theories and explanations but also for the content of and means by which we make rational policy decisions about interventions into that complexity. (Amato et al., 2009)</li>
<li>What are the <strong>implications</strong> if we don’t do these things? (Amato et al., 2009)</li>
<li>Because the consequences of the same genomic strategy for different agricultural plants are different, say for Bt corn and Bt potatoes, even if we understood all the <strong>implications</strong> in the case of Bt potatoes, these would not necessarily apply directly to the case of Bt corn. (Amato et al., 2009)</li>
<li>The empirical data of genetics (as revealed by molecular techniques or other methods) are interpreted using the analytical tools of population genetics and systematics, which permit estimation of parameters that frequently carry management <strong>implications</strong>, such as levels of genetic diversity within populations, patterns of mate choice, biological parentage and kinship, magnitudes of gene flow (and demographic connectedness) between populations, levels of introgressive exchange between hybridizing species, the nature of species boundaries, and phylogenetic relationships among higher taxa (Avise, 1994). (Avise, Hamrick, 1996)</li>
<li>These competing views of the genetic ramifications of inbreeding have been debated for decades (Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1987), generally remain unresolved (Lacy, 1992), but carry different <strong>implications</strong> for management of endangered taxa. (Avise, Hamrick, 1996)</li>

<li>For example, the increasingly widespread view among plant taxonomists (e.g., Hickman, 1993), that species are never real entities, can have serious <strong>implications</strong> for plant classification (Edwards and Clinnick, 1993). (Avise, Hamrick, 1996)</li>
<li>This appears to be the general trend for many groups (Hickman, 1993), and has immediate <strong>implications</strong> for conservation biology due to the critical role taxonomy plays in the implementation of the U.S. (Avise, Hamrick, 1996)</li>

<li>Rapid loss of genetic variation in large captive populations of Drosophila flies: <strong>implications</strong> for the genetic management of captive populations. (Avise, Hamrick, 1996)</li>
<li>This has ethical <strong>implications</strong>, since frequentist trials’ need to randomize is what forces researchers to obtain “informed consent” from all participants, essentially reminding them that by entering the trial, they may not end up getting the new treatment, and this decision is based entirely on random chance.

<li>The <strong>implications</strong> for global haplotype-based methods are that association analyses are likely to lose power for the detection of common variants, owing to the transition from two tests, each with two degrees of freedom, to one test which may have as many as eight degrees of freedom.

<li>So too were the wider <strong>implications</strong> of a narrow-genetic base in plant breeding, and The International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR, now Biodiversity International) was established in 1974. (Bradshaw, 2016)</li>
<li>The functional consequences and contribution to phenotypic variation are still to be determined; plant breeders await the results and <strong>implications</strong> for their work with interest. (Bradshaw, 2016)</li>
<li>The <strong>implications</strong> are that during domestication of monocot plant species selection has concentrated on genes located in the terminal regions of chromosomes within areas of high recombination frequency, and that a large proportion of the genetic variation available for selection of superior plant genotypes has not been exploited. (Bradshaw, 2016)</li>
<li>The <strong>implications</strong> for breeders are clear: for as long as some phenotypic selection is required for quantitative traits in a breeding programme, at least some generations of the programme will need to be assessed in field trials. (Bradshaw, 2016)</li>
<li>Ultimately, an understanding of the physiological and biochemical bases of stress tolerance and resource use efficiency, and their <strong>implications</strong> for yield potential, are required if the breeder is to be provided with selection criteria for manipulating G <u+fffd> E.

<li>This will not necessarily be detrimental to forest resources in all places, but could have both positive and negative <strong>implications</strong> for forests and forestry. (Fenning, 2014)</li>
<li>Many of the <strong>implications</strong> of this for forest management and use have been described in the previous sections on driving forces and outlook. (Fenning, 2014)</li>

(Fenning, 2014)</u+fffd></li>
<li>Low wood prices have very serious <strong>implications</strong> for future wood yields, as forests are already often seen as a poor investment option, further weakening the incentive to invest private or public capital in new plantations. (Fenning, 2014)</li>
<li>The enhancement of turbulence by rough (forest) surfaces has <strong>implications</strong> for the exchange of materials including water evaporating from the leaf surface and pollutants being deposited from the air: the rough surfaces of forest generates large scale turbulence and mixes the surface air with the air aloft. (Fenning, 2014)</li>
<li>Avissar and Werth (2005) propose that tropical deforestation of the Amazon disrupts the rainfall in Argentina, with severe <strong>implications</strong> for agriculture. (Fenning, 2014)</li>
<li>Thus, climate change has rather different <strong>implications</strong> for tropical, temperate and boreal forests (Fig. (Fenning, 2014)</li>
<li>These changes will have important <strong>implications</strong> for both agriculture and forestry, as spring will be earlier and the growing season will be extended; land which is now treeless (at high latitude or elevation) may support tree growth. (Fenning, 2014)</li>
<li>Similarly, extending forestry rotation lengths is recognised to increase carbon stocks sequestered in the biomass (Nabuurs et al. 2008), and is also likely to increase the quality and longevity of timber products obtained from the forest, although it has <strong>implications</strong> for windthrow risk. (Fenning, 2014)</li>
<li>The <strong>implications</strong> for invasive forest insects are unclear, but since birds are important predators of many herbivorous insects, especially in low-density insect populations (Holmes et al. (Fenning, 2014)</li>

<li>The Long Delay Following this shift in his thinking, Darwin immediately began elaborating a comprehensive theory of evolution together with its many <strong>implications</strong>. (Levin, 2013)</li>
<li>In the mid-1970s, fossil flowers, important because of their taxonomic and reproductive <strong>implications</strong>, became serious and sustained objects of study, resulting in a more informative fossil record of angiosperms and a better understanding of their diversification pattern (Crepet et al., 2004; Crepet, 2008, Crepet and Niklas, 2009).  morphological/structural characters that was once interpreted as evidence of a close relationship with angiosperms (e.g., Crane, 1985; Doyle and Donoghue, 1986; Nixon et al., 1994; Rothwell and Serbet, 1994). (Levin, 2013)</li>
<li>Given the <strong>implications</strong> of nucleic acid sequence based phylogenies, the characters in Gnetales that putatively linked them with angiosperms (e.g., including netveined leaves, a form of double fertilization, bisexual reproductive structures (Figure 1), the presence of vessels in the wood, and sterile structures surrounding ovules) are now  Studies of Angiosperm Origin In recent years, new analytical methods, new data sources, and newly discovered fossils have brought us much closer to an understanding of the origin of angiosperms. (Levin, 2013)</li>
<li>In approaching the fossil record, as with evaluations of extant taxa that might be germane to angiosperm origin, we might consider what to look for in addressing the question of angiosperm origin and then consider appropriate fossils and the <strong>implications</strong> of these fossils.

<li>Should additional characters and analyses continue to support the phylogenetic placement of Archaefructus on the stem lineage below all other angiosperms, the <strong>implications</strong> of the aquatic habit in Archaefructus and questions as to whether an aquatic bottleneck was involved in the consolidation of angiospermous reproductive features will undoubtedly be pursued (e.g., Did carpels evolve in response to selection for protecting developing ovules while still submerged?

<li>Forest genetics can help us understand the <strong>implications</strong> and guide applications of silvicultural reforestation operations such as seed tree and shelterwood systems in forests managed with natural regeneration. (White, Adams, Neale, 2007)</li>
<li>While these <strong>implications</strong> of the Hardy-Weinberg Principle apply strictly only to populations in perfect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the concepts are widely useful, because many natural populations of outcrossing species have genotype frequencies that approximate those predicted by Equation 5.3. (White, Adams, Neale, 2007)</li>
<li>Most of the <strong>implications</strong> mentioned in Box 5.2 arise because when q is small, most of the A2 allele occurs in heterozygous form. (White, Adams, Neale, 2007)</li>

<li>This has two <strong>implications</strong>: (1) The  132 Quantitative Genetics phenotypic correlation may have little utility in making genetic inferences (see below and Chapter 13), so we must estimate the genetic correlation; and (2) Randomized, replicated field experiments employing offspring from many parents are required to estimate the underlying causal correlations (i.e. the genetic and environmental correlations).

<li>This limitation of MM methods has two <strong>implications</strong>: (1) Extreme care is warranted when MM methods are applied to small data sets, because imprecise estimates of the variance and covariance components can lead to poor-quality genetic value predictions; and (2) The linear models should not be over specified with too many model effects, because it is more difficult to estimate variances and covariances for complex systems. (White, Adams, Neale, 2007)</li>
<li>The <strong>implications</strong> of the above OLS assumption are: (1) All residuals have the same variance (i.e. o2e); and (2) All possible pairs of residuals are uncorrelated. (White, Adams, Neale, 2007)</li>
<li>This has two <strong>implications</strong>: (1) An interim source of seed is required to meet immediate seed needs (and two methods of doing this are described in this section); and (2) The organization should focus on rapid development of their own propagation population (e.g. seed orchard or clonal garden) to produce higher-quality improved plants for operational reforestation as soon as possible. (White, Adams, Neale, 2007)</li>
<li>The <strong>implications</strong> are: (1) Gains from deployment options include the gains made in the breeding cycle proper, therefore all deployment options benefit from a well designed and properly implemented breeding strategy (Chapter 17); (2) Gains from a deployment option apply to the plantations established with that improved variety, and the benefits are realized when those plantations are harvested; and (3) Incremental gains from a deployment option above those from the breeding cycle are not generally carried back into the breeding cycle (e.g. the extra benefits of CF apply only to the plantations established during that generation; those gains are not cumulative as are the gains from the central activities of the breeding cycle (Fig. (White, Adams, Neale, 2007)</li>
<li>Compared to using fewer but larger breeding groups, having a large number of breeding groups each with fewer selections has the following <strong>implications</strong> (Baker and Curnow, 1969; Kang and Nienstaedt, 1987; Lindgren et al, 1996; Gea et al, 1997; McKeand and Bridgwater, 1998): (1) Less genetic gain for the first several generations of breeding; (2) More rapid build up of relatedness and inbreeding within each of the small groups; and (3) Maintenance of more genetic diversity in the population as a whole with most of the variability being distributed among groups.
